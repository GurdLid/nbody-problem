# N-Body problem

Simple demonstration of the N-Body problem with the 3 inner most planets in the Milky Way, along with Earth's moon and the Sun. 
## Description

The N-Body problem can be represented as a system of Initial Value Problems (IVPs), which can then be solved using a number of Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers. The intital solver used here is the symplectic Euler method.
